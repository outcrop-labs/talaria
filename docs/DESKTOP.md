# Talaria Desktop

The desktop app is a **multitenant shell** around Talaria instances — the connect-out half of
the roadmap's business-multitenancy line ("swap between them in a click … connect out to other
hosted Talaria instances"). It is deliberately NOT a second UI codebase: the interior is always
the real web UI, loaded live from each instance's origin. The only local frontend is the
launcher's welcome screen.

Built on [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/) (Rust shell + WebKitGTK webviews on Linux), tracked
in [`desktop/`](../desktop).

## How it works

Two views, one window:

- **welcome** — the launcher (webview label `main`, local content from `desktop/src`) fills the
  window: the wing mark on the signature dither field, the instance list, add. The brand
  treatment is ported, not imitated — `WingMark.svelte`, `DitherLayer.svelte` + `lib/dither.ts`
  are verbatim from ui/ (keep them in step), and typography is Mercury's IBM Plex pair.
- **active** — the instance's webview IS the window; the launcher is hidden (but alive).
  Switching happens **inside the instance UI**: the desktop switcher
  (`ui/src/components/app/DesktopSwitcher.svelte`) wears the current instance's identity
  (avatar chip + label) beside the logo in the nav rail — and in the login screen's top-left
  corner, so a signed-out instance is not a dead end. It renders ONLY inside the shell: the
  guard is `inDesktopShell()` from `ui/src/lib/desktop-shell.ts` (a function, evaluated at
  render — module-load order must never decide it), and a browser gets nothing. `Ctrl/Cmd+
  Shift+H` (an initialization script the shell injects into every instance webview) is the
  floor: it opens the launcher even on instances whose Talaria version predates the switcher.

Each instance webview gets its own `data_directory`, so cookie jars and localStorage never mix
— cookies ignore ports, so without this, two dev instances on `127.0.0.1:530x` would silently
share a session. Hidden webviews stay loaded: sessions and SSE survive a switch.

Adding an instance: the shell normalizes the URL (bare hosts become `https://`, only http(s),
credentials/paths stripped — an instance IS its origin), then probes the instance beacon
(`GET /api/well-known/talaria-instance` → `{instance, companyName}`). A valid beacon uuid is
what makes a URL "a Talaria instance"; the uuid is also the dedupe key. The label comes from
`companyName`, falling back to host(:port).

The registry is `~/.local/share/app.talaria.desktop/instances.json` (atomic writes), and each
instance's session data lives beside it in `instances/<id>/webview/`. Removing an instance
deletes its data dir — the saved session dies with it; the instance itself is untouched.

## Security posture

- **Instance webviews get exactly three commands, nothing else.** The shell's commands are
  gated behind capabilities (`AppManifest::commands` in `desktop/src-tauri/build.rs`); the
  launcher holds all of them (`capabilities/launcher.json`), and each REGISTERED instance
  origin gets a runtime grant (`grant_switcher` in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, via Tauri's
  dynamic-ACL) scoped to `list_instances`, `activate_instance`, `show_welcome` on that one
  webview. No fs, no window, no core permissions — remote content can switch instances and
  nothing else. An origin the user never registered gets no IPC at all.
- Login happens inside each instance webview via the instance's own flows (password or
  OAuth). **Known limitation:** Google blocks OAuth inside embedded webviews; password login
  works, and for dev instances a session can be minted into Redis directly (see the
  `repo-traps` skill).
- The shell never holds instance credentials; it holds URLs.

## WebKitGTK geometry (the fragile part)

Multiwebview-per-window rides Tauri's `unstable` cargo feature, with known Linux bugs:
children can be misplaced ([tauri#10420]) and `auto_resize` breaks across resize cycles
([tauri#10131]) — and in practice the two webviews have even been observed STACKING
VERTICALLY in the GTK container. The design leans on none of it: exactly ONE webview is
visible at a time (`hide()`/`show()` decide who renders; bounds calls are belt-and-suspenders
in logical units, recomputed on every `WindowEvent::Resized`), so there is no side-by-side
layout to get wrong. `tauri` is exact-pinned (`=2.11.5`) in `desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` —
unstable features are semver-exempt, so upgrades are deliberate.

## WebKit, not Chrome

The engine is WebKitGTK, so the instance UI runs under WebKit (Safari-family) semantics, not
Blink. APIs Chrome has that WebKit lacks (e.g. `requestIdleCallback`) are landmines in ui/
code even for browser Safari — feature-detect with `typeof x === 'function'`, never a bare
reference (a bare global throws ReferenceError before `??` can fall back).

## Development: the box builds, the host runs

A devbox has no display, so the split is: **code and gates in the box, GUI on the host** (the
box's clone is host-visible at `~/Development/devboxes/<name>/talaria`).

```sh
# host, once: the webkit runtime (Arch; gtk3 rides along)
sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1 librsvg

# host: image (carries the tauri build deps) and the box
bun talaria box build
bun talaria box new desktop

# in the box — the gates (CARGO_TARGET_DIR keeps cargo artifacts OFF the
# host-shared tree; the host's build uses desktop/src-tauri/target, and two
# cargo builds into one target dir fight)
bun talaria box enter desktop
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$HOME/target-desktop bun run desktop:check

# in the box — a live instance to point the shell at (seeded at box creation)
bun talaria dev          # → http://127.0.0.1:5302

# on the host — the GUI (vite for the launcher, then the binary)
cd ~/Development/devboxes/desktop/talaria/desktop
bun install              # shares node_modules with the box: same bun, same platform
bun run dev:vite &       # the launcher's dev server on :5290
./src-tauri/target/debug/talaria-desktop
```

In the app: *Add instance* → `http://127.0.0.1:5302`. The switcher appears the moment that
instance's UI loads (login screen included). Prove isolation with a second instance on the
same host at a different port (another box, or the primary stack) — log into both and swap;
both sessions survive.

One dev-loop trap: `tauri dev`'s watcher kills and relaunches the app on source/config
change, and on WebKitGTK that kill has been observed to corrupt the relaunched process
(silent death, sometimes `free(): corrupted unsorted chunks`). If the window doesn't come
back after a rebuild, stop the dev process and start it again — or, with vite still up, run
the binary directly as above.

## Gates

`bun run desktop:check` (root) = `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy -D warnings` +
`cargo test` + `svelte-check`, the same list CI's `desktop` job runs. `bun run verify` is
unchanged — the desktop surface gates per-surface, exactly like `api:check`.

## Deferred on purpose

Rename/reorder instances, health badges, native notifications, tray, deep links,
macOS/Windows (where `data_directory` is a no-op — macOS needs `data_store_identifier`),
OAuth via external browser, bundle/installer targets.
