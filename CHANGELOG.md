# Changelog

All notable changes to Talaria. Milestone labels refer to [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md).

## [Unreleased]: Phase 6 — product depth (2026-07-06)

Turning the elegant shell into a capable product: one place to manage each
agent, attachments, personal assistants, governance, and a real audit trail.

### Added
- **Unified agent management modal**, one modal per agent with tabs — Summary ·
  Config · Skills · Memory · MCP · Versions. Every internal (previously separate
  top-level pages) lives here: config editing, skills (WYSIWYG + history),
  memory, MCP with live connection testing, and version history with one-click
  revert. Read-only for non-admins.
- **Agents roster redesign**, a toggleable **grid / list** where each agent
  shows only name, **role**, a health dot (up/degraded/down/retired/legacy from
  real container state), and icon controls (start/stop · manage · duplicate ·
  retire/migrate/re-hire). Detail moved into the modal.
- **Editable agent roles** (`agent_defs.role`) — a human title (e.g. "Support
  Lead") shown on the roster, set at creation, editable in the modal.
- **Re-hire + duplicate**, retired agents can be un-retired (re-enable → render →
  start from the preserved volume); any agent can be duplicated into a new one.
  Retire is a typed-slug double opt-in.
- **Fleet Reconcile**, one button renders all managed configs and starts every
  enabled agent that isn't running (drift + cold start; reboot survival is
  already handled by `restart: unless-stopped`).
- **Personal assistants**, everyone can spin up their own Hermes agent (own
  container, key, memory) from Home — `agent_defs.owner_user_id`,
  `createPersonalAgent()`, a "Your assistant" card.
- **Attachments in chat + channels**, images and documents (disk-backed
  `uploads` table, served from `/api/uploads/:id`); images render inline and are
  passed to vision models as data-URL content parts.
- **Per-view access control**, admins grant/revoke each primary view per member
  (`users.denied_views`); denied views are hidden from the nav and route-gated.
- **Audit trail + retention**, a real `audit_log` (actor · action · target ·
  before/after) wired into governance mutations, surfaced to admins on the Audit
  page; `audit_retention_days` is the first admin-editable app setting.
- **Chat tier picker**, the composer's raw model-tier `<select>` is now a
  premium portaled pill.

### Changed
- **Models page** is compact: provider cards show identity + a model count +
  Manage; the model list (with a proper catalog-search **add-model** flow, not a
  LabelPicker), pricing, class, and privacy routing moved into a modal.
- **Modals center on the viewport** (portaled to `<body>`) instead of within a
  backdrop-filtered card.

## [Unreleased]: Phase 5 — product IA + elegance (2026-07-06)

Reworking Talaria from a feature grid into a coherent product: two mental
modes, a real landing, versioned internals, and a self-hostable vocabulary.

### Added
- **Home / Today** at `/`, the seamless landing. In Talaria's guardrail model a
  person's job is to triage, review, and unblock the agents' work, so Home
  surfaces exactly those queues (scoped to your boards) plus unread mentions,
  quick entries into the work surfaces, and an accurate fleet-health glance
  (real container status). Chat moves to `/chat`.
- **Talaria LLM gateway** ([`server/llm-gateway.ts`]), one OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint over the whole model registry (`/api/llm/v1/{models,chat/completions}`,
  streaming). Provider keys stay server-side; per-endpoint `request_defaults`
  merge into every call; usage is metered per key. **Per-user API keys**
  (`tlk_…`, minted in Settings → API keys, admin-grantable via `can_mint_keys`).
- **No-train routing as a setting**, a per-cloud-endpoint toggle on /models
  (OpenRouter no-store allowlist + `data_collection: deny`, or portable deny) —
  privacy is opt-in, not baked in.
- **Versioned skills + memory**, every save is an immutable, authored revision
  (`internal_versions`); recover or load any prior one. Edited in a **WYSIWYG
  modal** (RichEditor + a history rail) — the raw textareas are gone.
- **MCP connection testing**, live status chips (Connected / Login required /
  Unreachable / Error) via a real MCP `initialize` probe carrying the agent's
  identity, plus a premium add-server modal that tests before saving.

### Changed
- **Navigation regrouped** into **Work** (Home · Chat · Channels · Boards ·
  Inbox) and **Manage** (Agents · Models · Compute · Cost · Audit · Alerts) +
  System — simple for the non-technical surfaces, control grouped for the
  technical ones. Skills/Memory/MCP/Models moved off the top nav into the Agents
  page. Fleet overview folded into Agents (`/fleet` → `/agents`).
- **"Local" → "Self-hosted"** in all user-facing copy (people run models on
  local machines *and* other on-prem boxes). "Local inference" → **Compute**,
  "Activity" → **Audit**.

### Removed
- The dead **`/tasks`** nav item (it matched the boards API route; no page ever
  existed behind it).

## [Unreleased]: Phase 2 UI (2026-07-02)

Talaria's own front end ([`ui/`](./ui), Vite + TanStack Start) grows a full,
self-hosted **project-management suite**, owned in Talaria's own Postgres/Redis,
not proxied from mission-control.

### Added
- **Boards & teams**, shareable kanban boards (personal or team-owned), a
  consolidated **Board settings** modal (General / People / Agents), board-scoped
  agent policy (restrictive by default), teams + member management, and soft
  **archive** for boards and tickets.
- **Tickets**, rich detail modal: TipTap WYSIWYG description (markdown under the
  hood) with read/edit toggle + slide-in full-screen editor, syntax-highlighted
  code + hover links, comments (Ctrl+Enter to send), an **Activity** tab, watchers,
  and a quality-review approval gate.
- **Ticket routes**, each ticket is a directly-linkable nested route
  (`/boards/:boardId/:taskId`) with copy-link buttons on cards, list rows, and the
  modal.
- **Fields**, agent-appropriate **effort** (XS-XL), **multiple assignees**
  (board-scoped agents only), ticket **dependencies** (blocked-by / blocks), labels,
  due date, and **auto-accumulated time-spent** (`addTimeSpentSeconds`). Manual hour
  estimates removed.
- **Blocked status**, a new kanban column for stalled / needs-input work.
- **List view**, configurable, drag-reorderable, click-to-sort columns, persisted
  per board.
- **Multiplayer**, live boards via Redis pub/sub → SSE (`/api/boards/:id/events`).
- **Reusable UI primitives**, `CloseButton`, `CopyLinkButton`, `InlineCreate`,
  `danger` button variant; `RichEditor` gains `bare` / `fill` / `onSubmit` modes.
- **Agent guardrails**, on `PUT /api/tasks/:id`, agents may triage but cannot
  self-assign (`assigned` → 403) or self-complete (`done` → `quality_review`), and
  cannot change assignees.
- **Agent MCP (`talaria-mcp`)** ([`mcp/`](./mcp)), an MCP server exposing only the
  safe tools (`list_boards`, `list_tickets`, `get_ticket`, `create_ticket`,
  `triage_ticket`, `comment`, `report_outcome`, `add_time`, `add_dependency`) — no
  assign, no complete; guardrails hold by construction. Identity via
  `TALARIA_AGENT_KEY` + `TALARIA_AGENT_NAME`.
- **Agent-authed task API**, the fleet key plus a new `x-agent-name` header opens
  an agent path on boards list, board tasks (list + create → `inbox`, never
  assigned), ticket detail, comments, and add-dependency. Every agent call is
  checked against the board's agent policy and attributed to the named agent in
  activity/comments. Named agents on `PUT /api/tasks/:id` are policy-checked too;
  unnamed key callers (legacy plugin heartbeat/report) keep their old access.
- **Group chat (channels)**, Slack-style channels where teammates and fleet
  agents are members. Channels + members + agents + messages live in Talaria's
  Postgres; live over Redis pub/sub → SSE (`/api/channels/:id/events`). Agents
  reply when **@mentioned** (by name or model id): the reply streams into the
  channel for every member, built from the channel transcript via the gateway
  plane. Composer has @mention autocomplete; channel settings manage people +
  agents (adding an agent requires access to it). New "Channels" nav surface.

- **People pickers**, one searchable `UserPicker` (over `GET /api/users`, everyone
  who has signed in) replaces every type-an-email field: board sharing, board
  creation invites, teams, and channel members.
- **Label picker**, ticket labels are tag chips + the shared combobox: the board's
  existing labels surface for reuse, and typing creates a new one (Enter or comma).
  Replaces the raw comma-separated text input.
- **Display names**, users can set how they appear (Settings → profile; updates the
  live session, no re-login). Member lists, channel messages, and avatars prefer
  the name and show the email as secondary.
- **Consistent control sizing**, one `sm`/`md` scale (`h-9`/`h-11`) shared by
  Button, Input, Select, and Combobox via a `size` prop — mixed-height form rows
  and hand-set `h-8`/`h-9` overrides are gone.
- **Notifications + user @mentions**, the channel composer autocompletes human
  members alongside agents; @mentioning a person drops a notification in their
  **Inbox** (new nav surface with an unread badge). `GET/PUT /api/notifications`;
  mention tokens are the email localpart, dashed name, or first name.
- **Token ledger**, every agent generation (1:1 chat turn + channel reply) lands
  in `usage_events` — real gateway-reported counts (`stream_options.include_usage`),
  or char-based estimates flagged `~` when the gateway doesn't report. The `/cost`
  page is live: today/7d/30d token tiles, a 14-day daily strip, and a per-agent
  breakdown. Dollar cost lands with per-LLM pricing attribution (see ROADMAP).
- **Admin console**, `/admin` is live: everyone who has signed in, with role
  management (member/admin; `AUTH_ADMIN_EMAILS` admins are pinned, no
  self-demotion) and the per-person agent allow-list UI (empty = all agents) that
  the access model always supported. Admin-gated `GET/PUT /api/admin/users`.
- **Agent harness (phase A)**, Talaria starts becoming the fleet's source of
  truth: `llm_endpoints` (model backends classed local/cloud — feeds the coming
  cost split), `agent_defs` + immutable `agent_versions` (soul, main model,
  `model_aliases` tiers, fallbacks, plugins, MCP servers — diffable, revertible),
  and an idempotent importer that ingests the existing `ai/orchestration` stack
  (`agents.yaml`, per-agent `config.yaml` + `SOUL.md`). `/agents` grows an
  admin-only **Definitions** panel showing each agent's tiers (local/cloud chips),
  fallback chain, soul, and version. Rendering + spin up/down land in phase B.
- **Agent harness (phase B)**, Talaria renders and runs the fleet: versions
  materialize into a gitignored `fleet/` dir (per-agent `config.yaml` emitted as
  YAML 1.1 so PyYAML sees exactly the original semantics, `SOUL.md`, a generated
  compose that reuses the legacy `ai_hermes-<dept>` volumes so memories survive,
  and the gateway manifest — which the bridge now **hot-reloads**, no restart).
  `/agents` gains live container status and lifecycle buttons: start/stop for
  managed agents, one-click **Migrate** for legacy ones (stop old → render →
  start managed → health-gate). Pilot migrated: `sam-support` runs Talaria-managed
  with memories intact, answering through the gateway.
- **Agent harness (phase C1: config control)**, edit an agent **in-app** — soul,
  main model, alias tiers, fallback chain, all against the endpoint registry —
  and save as a new immutable version; **Save & apply** re-renders and restarts
  the managed container. Reverts re-publish an old payload as a new version
  (history is append-only). Structured edits are merged into the raw Hermes
  config so rendering stays faithful.
- **Local vs cloud in the ledger**, every generation now records the serving
  model's endpoint class (from the agent's current main endpoint) + model id.
  `/cost` shows the 30-day local/cloud share bar, a stacked per-day strip, and a
  per-agent "% local" column — the view for optimizing the small-model/frontier
  mixture.
- **Models tab**, a System-area registry for model backends: one-click presets
  for **every common US provider** (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Meta,
  OpenRouter, Groq, Together, Fireworks, Cerebras, Perplexity, DeepInfra,
  DeepSeek, local Ollama/vLLM) with base URLs and wiring preconfigured — pick,
  name the key env var, done. Local/cloud is **inferred** (never asked for known
  providers; LAN/loopback URL heuristic for custom). Provider marks throughout;
  the provider chooser and the model tier picker are the same searchable
  combobox. Each provider card offers its **live catalog** (server-side
  `/models` fetch, keys never leave the box) so you search what the provider
  actually serves; per-provider **model catalogs** (tag-style add/remove) and
  cloud pricing fields.
  The agent editor's clunky selects are replaced by **one searchable picker**
  over every catalog. Deleting a model or provider that agents still use warns
  with the blast radius and **double opt-ins**, then cascades: each affected
  agent gets a new version with the tier stripped (revertible), re-rendered,
  running managed agents restarted. A model that is some agent's **main** is
  never cascaded — reassign first.
- **Agent harness (phase C2: create/retire)**, spin agents up and down on a
  whim. **New agent** on `/agents`: pick a template (any existing agent — model
  tiers/tools/plugins carry over with every identity reference re-stamped to the
  new slug), Talaria allocates a fresh gateway key into the stack `.env`, writes
  v1 with a starter soul, renders a fresh-chassis service (own state volume),
  starts it, and the bridge picks it up live. **Retire** removes the container
  and drops the agent from the fleet manifest; state volume + version history
  stay.

- **Pricing**, real dollars in the ledger: per-model $/MTok prices live on each
  provider (Models page grid; endpoint-level rates as fallback; Anthropic preset
  ships with official prices), every generation records its serving endpoint,
  and cost computes at read time — editing a price reprices history instantly.
  `/cost` gains a **Cloud spend** tile (30d + today), per-model $ in the split
  legend, a per-agent $ column, and a loud warning for **unpriced** cloud tokens
  (never silently $0). Local tokens are $0 by definition.
- **Model-tier routing**, chat any agent on any of its configured tiers: the
  fleet manifest now carries one gateway entry per alias (`<base>-<alias>`,
  resolved by the agent's own Hermes gateway), `/api/agents` returns real
  agents (not raw gateway models) with their tiers, the chat composer gains a
  tier select, and the API validates tiers against the agent's definition. The
  ledger attributes tier-routed turns by the **alias's** endpoint — a `glm`
  turn lands as cloud/glm while main-model turns stay local.
- **Auto-fetched pricing**, zero-config rates: a server-side price oracle pulls
  OpenRouter's public model catalog (no key) and prices every matched cloud
  model automatically (`llm_endpoints.auto_prices`, refreshed in the background
  and on provider/model changes). Cost coalesces user override → auto → endpoint
  default; the pricing grid shows an "auto" tag with fetched rates as
  placeholders. No exact match → honestly unpriced, never guessed.
- **Channel tier mentions**, `@Dex:deepseek` routes that reply to the tier; the
  composer autocompletes `Label:tier`; unknown tiers fall back to main; the
  ledger attributes the turn to the alias endpoint.
- **Activity** (`/activity`), one merged, user-scoped feed — ticket events,
  channel messages, agent config versions — with kind filters. A read model
  over existing tables; nothing new stored.
- **Alerts** (`/alerts`), live-derived health: down/unhealthy managed
  containers, unreachable gateway plane, unpriced cloud usage,
  estimate-dominated ledger, failed and week-stale blocked tickets. Severity
  ranked, deep-linked, nothing to configure.
- **Skills** (`/skills`), the fleet's skills as they exist on disk (shared
  stack dir + each agent's dept/fleet mount): parsed descriptions, live
  SKILL.md editing, admin create/delete. Hermes reads skills per invocation,
  so edits apply on the next run — no restart.
- **Memory** (`/memory`), each managed agent's `memories/MEMORY.md` read and
  written through its running container — no second copy to drift.
- **MCP** (`/mcp`), per-agent MCP servers from the versioned config: add and
  remove as NEW immutable config versions (optionally applied live), untouched
  entries preserved byte-for-byte; plus a talaria-mcp explainer.
- **Inference** (`/inference`), your own hardware: local backends probed live
  (status, latency, serving-now models) plus local token throughput.
- **Per-ticket token spend**, agents report tokens burned on a ticket
  (`POST /api/tasks/:id/usage`, MCP tool `log_usage`, board policy enforced,
  tier-aware); reports are first-class priced ledger rows; the ticket rail
  shows tokens · $ · per-model.
- **Plan chat**, a channel's **Plan** button turns the conversation into
  tickets: a chosen agent (any tier) drafts structured proposals from the
  transcript, a human edits/prunes them in a review modal and creates the
  keepers — into inbox, never assigned.

### Fixed
- SSE event streams no longer crash the server when a client disconnects before
  the Redis subscriber finishes connecting (unhandled rejection in the
  board/channel event stream).
- Ticket labels no longer require hand-typed comma lists (see label picker).
- Logging in no longer clobbers a user-set display name (the provider identity
  only fills the unfriendly defaults).

### Changed
- Sessions are Redis-backed (opaque sid → `sess:<sid>`), not HMAC cookies.

## [Unreleased]: 0.1.0

Initial working slice: hermes-workspace ↔ mission-control bridge + per-agent adapter plugin.
All milestones below verified live against a running stack on 2026-07-01
([`scripts/verify-stack.sh`](./scripts/verify-stack.sh), all checks pass).

### Added
- **Gateway plane** (`bridge/src/gatewayPlane.ts`), the fleet multiplexer. Fronts the Hermes gateway
  `:8642` for a whole fleet: `/v1/models` = every agent, `/v1/chat/completions` routed by model to that
  agent's real gateway (per-agent key, SSE streamed). One workspace talks to every agent via the model
  switcher. Fleet declared in a manifest (`TALARIA_FLEET`/`TALARIA_FLEET_FILE`). Stood up the Phase-1
  fleet engine as a two-plane runtime (gateway multiplexer + dashboard management bridge).
- **Bridge** (`bridge/`, Node/TS), transparent reverse-proxy of the Hermes dashboard `:9119`.
  - **M1** pass-through: all 164 dashboard routes (incl. OAuth + 4 websockets) proxied byte-for-byte
    to the real dashboard; conductor capability-probe (`GET /api/conductor/missions`) served as
    `200 application/json` so the workspace uses remote dispatch instead of native-swarm.
  - **M2** mission create: `POST /api/conductor/missions {name,prompt}` → mission-control
    `POST /api/tasks`, response shaped for the Conductor.
  - **M3** status round-trip: `GET/DELETE /api/conductor/missions/{id}` poll + cancel, mapping
    mission-control task status → the workspace mission enum. Never forces the Aegis-gated `done`.
- **Fleet board**, the bridge serves the workspace's `/api/plugins/kanban/*` surface from
  mission-control, so the swarm/kanban board becomes a live view of the MC fleet (columns = MC
  statuses, cards = MC tasks, full CRUD; `done` stays Aegis-gated). Toggle `TALARIA_KANBAN_FROM_MC=0`.
  The conductor poll's `lines` are also enriched with the task's header + comment feed.
- **Plugin** (`plugin/talaria/`, Hermes standalone), per-agent mission-control adapter.
  - **M3** register (`POST /api/agents/register`) + opt-in background heartbeat
    (`TALARIA_HEARTBEAT_SECONDS`) that polls `/api/agents/{id}/heartbeat` + reports via
    `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` (toward `quality_review`, never `done`). Safe no-op until configured.
- **mission-control adapter** (`adapter/`), **M4** `HermesAdapter` making Hermes a first-class
  framework in mission-control; PR-ready patch + verification.
- **Stack** (`stack/`), compose wiring workspace + mission-control + bridge on the shared `edge`
  network; `scripts/verify-stack.sh` reproduces the M1-M3 verification end-to-end.
- **Docs**, [`docs/m0-contract.md`](./docs/m0-contract.md) (the M0 contract diff + `:9119` allowlist),
  README with architecture + compatibility matrix.
- **Fleet: both Hermes deployment shapes** (`bridge/src/config.ts`, `gatewayPlane.ts`, `sessions.ts`) -
  a fleet entry now supports (A) separate installs (one gateway per agent) and (B) multiple Hermes
  profiles on one host (each profile's API server on its own port). Optional `profile` / `upstreamModel`
  / `pathPrefix` fields: Talaria rewrites the forwarded `model` to the profile when set and honours a
  profile path prefix on chat + session calls. The UI only ever sees Talaria's exposed model ids.
  `pathPrefix` seeds support for Hermes' emerging single-endpoint profile multiplex (`multiplex_profiles`).
- **Phase 2 UI** (`ui/`), the first slice of Talaria's own front end (Vite + TanStack Start, React 19,
  TypeScript), matching the hermes-workspace stack so its chat components lift cleanly.
  - **Mercury design system** (`ui/src/styles.css`, `ui/src/lib/theme.ts`), hand-rolled Tailwind v4
    tokens, dark (`mercury`) + light (`mercury-light`), violet→magenta neon on Mercury-planet neutrals.
    Reuses hermes-workspace's `--theme-*` token contract to keep component lifts frictionless.
  - **Pluggable auth**, each provider independently enable-able (flag **+** secrets required):
    registry (`ui/src/server/auth/config.ts`), stateless HMAC-signed sessions, **Google OAuth**
    (start + callback) and username/password, with routes `/api/auth/{providers,session,google,
    google/callback,password,logout}`. Login screen renders only the enabled providers. Verified live:
    session round-trip, logout, tampered-cookie rejection, provider gating.
  - Both upstreams vendored under `vendor/` (gitignored) as lift sources.

### Key findings (verified against source)
- The Hermes dashboard has **no** `/api/conductor/*` routes, Talaria *serves* them (adds capability),
  it does not override native behavior. Unset `HERMES_DASHBOARD_URL` → 100% native.
- mission-control gates `done` behind **Aegis** approval; Talaria respects it (human-only Done).
- mission-control has no published image (builds from source, pinned `d09e608`).

### Not yet
- Decomposed/broadcast mission parity (those go workspace-local `:3000`), needs the
  `HERMES_MISSION_API_URL` upstream PR to hermes-workspace.
- Executing pulled work inside the Hermes run loop (heartbeat pulls; in-agent dispatch is next).
- Enabling the plugin on the live PackLedger fleet (staged, not yet `--force-recreate`d).
